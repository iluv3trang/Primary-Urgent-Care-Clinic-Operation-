## Primary Urgent Care Clinic Operation

Healthcare is a fundamental aspect of society, and clinics serve as primary access points for medical care. The effectiveness of clinic operations directly influences patient well-being and satisfaction. We can make real-world improvements in healthcare delivery by addressing clinic operational issues. This project aims to analyze and improve the operational efficiency of a clinic system by employing discrete event simulation techniques. Our primary objective is to enhance the patient experience by reducing waiting times and optimizing the utilization of clinic staff. To achieve this, we collected data on patient arrivals and service times, implemented a simulation model using JaamSim, and assessed the system's performance over an 11-hour period.
We recognized that patient waiting times and clinic staff utilization were critical areas of concern within the clinic system. Long waiting times can lead to patient dissatisfaction and inefficiencies, while underutilized staff can increase operational costs. Using JaamSim, we created a discrete event simulation model based on observed probability distributions of patient interarrival times and service times. This model allowed us to mimic real-world clinic operations and identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
The simulation results provided valuable insights into the clinic’s performance. We observed patients' waiting times were long, raising concerns about patient satisfaction and clinic efficiency. Moreover, the number of patients being seen was lower than the number of patients arriving. Staff utilization rates were unbalanced, with some staff members experiencing significantly lower workloads than others. We recommend several strategies to enhance the clinic’s efficiency and reduce patient waiting times based on our findings. These include adding a nurse, optimizing staff level, and pre-informing patients about waiting time. Implementing these recommendations will lead to well-organized clinic operations, delivering efficient and effective services.
